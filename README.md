# Angular 2 Firebase App

An app boilerplate using:

- [Angular 4](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aangular+org%3Aangular&type=Repositories)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Firebase (angularfire2)](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)
- [Ngrx Store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) and [Ngrx Effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects)

featuring:

- A full authentication pipeline including both Google and email authentication
- User accounts
- Business logic (using todos as an example)

## Motivation and Highlights

The purpose of this boilerplate is to provide a more advanced starting point for angular 2 apps that already features a well defined workflow, state management and design layout.

The template is designed to be easy to build upon and extend to suit your app.
